# Rules

To keep this community a safe and supportive environment for everyone, we have a certain set of rules. 

If you are unsure of any of the rules or wish to discuss the rules, be sure to DM an Operator. 

## 1. Keep conversations civil

### Keep arguments out
Don't start arguments. Treat this server as a school and learning environment. If you want to say something that you wouldn't say at school, do not say it here.
### Keep controversial content out
This includes, but is not limited to:
 - Politics
 - Religion

### Stay on topic

This server was created to be a community centered around developing, programming, coding, and the like. Channels centered around programming should have conversations about programming. 

Please do not derail other people's conversations by jumping in with a completely different topic. 

Please ask before joining a conversation.
### Keep opinions to yourself
Unless the opinions add to the conversation, please keep them to yourself.

How much you hate a certain language does not add to the conversation.

### No NSFW
Keep this server safe for all ages.

### No spoon-feeding
Spoon feeding is when you give a person the solution to a problem without letting them learn and figure out the solution. This harms the inquirer and doesn't help them in any way. 

### Keep criticism constructive
If you want to help someone, please phrase the comment in a non-imposing way.  




## 2. Be respectful

### Listen to our staff
Our staff has the final decision. We trust our staff to be fair to everyone, however, if you have a problem with a moderator's punishment, please use `-appeal <punishment ID>` in the `#detention-center` channel.

Please respect the staff and their discretion.

### Respect your peers
We are all learners here and we can learn from everyone, so treat everyone fairly. 

Doxing is **absolutely** not allowed. Respect your peer's right to their privacy.
Everyone has the right to their privacy.

Threats (even as jokes) are also prohibited and, depending on the severity of the threat, could lead to a ban.


## 3. Use English only
Using another language restricts our ability to moderate the chat. 

## 4. Nicknames and usernames
### No hoisting
Specifically using special characters to hoist your username up the member list will result in a nick change.
### Nicknames
We reserve the right to change your nickname, so it follows our rules.

## 5. Follow Discord ToS
*The Official Discord Terms of Service is found [here](https://discord.com/terms).*

According to the ToS, you must be 13 years of age or older. 

## 6. Illegal and prohibited topics are not allowed
Discussing illegal topics prohibited by the law or ToS is not allowed.
This includes, but is not limited to, DDoSing, threats, piracy, exploiting on games that prohibit exploiting, and more.

## 7. No advertising
Please do not advertise as this leeches off the community we worked hard to create.
This includes DM advertising. Exceptions can be made.

## 8. No life advice

This includes, but is not limited to: relationship advice, depression, or suicidal talk. We are not qualified to offer professional advice; it just does not belong here. Note that career-related advice is fine.

## 9. Use common sense

### Don't impersonate people
This includes staff and others. If you say you are someone, we will trust you. Please don't take advantage of this.

### Do not discuss infractions in public
DM an Operator if you want to discuss an infraction or mute: donâ€™t do it anywhere else on the server.

### Do not ask for free work
Programming is a skilled trade, so if you want development work, pay for it. Profit shares do not count as a form of payment.
